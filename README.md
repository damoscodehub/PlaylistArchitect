**Playlist Architect** is a Python-based application designed to help Spotify users manage their playlists. It gives a creative way of creating new playlist based on other playlists, besides other useful functionalities such as backup and bulk delete playlists.

It was born as a final project for the CS50‚Äôs course **`Introduction to Programming with Python`**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Playlist Architect interacts with the Spotify API to fetch and manage your playlists. Here's a quick overview of the workflow:

1. **Authentication**: The app uses Spotify's OAuth2 flow to authenticate users.
2. **Credential and permission request**: It ask for the credentials and permission needed to operates with the indicated Spotify account. 
3. **Playlist Retrieval**: It fetches all your playlists, including details like track count, duration, and owner.
4. **Instant reflect**: Every successfully accomplished action performed by the app is immediately seen in the Spotify account.

## ü§î Why Use Playlist Architect?

- **Time-Saving**: Quickly create playlists with custom time blocks instead of manually adding tracks.
- **Flexibility**: Mix and match tracks from different playlists to create unique listening experiences.
- **Backup Security**: Safeguard your playlists by exporting them to a file, ensuring you never lose your favorite collections.
- **User-Friendly**: The app features a simple, menu-driven interface that makes playlist management intuitive and accessible.

## üîí Limitations

- **API level**: At the time of this project's publication, the Spotify API does not allow access to either featured playlists (created and managed by Spotify itself) or user-created folders, so they can't be at all view or managed by this app.
- **Logic level**: playback time target set for each block is only an estimation. The app will try to fill that time with random tracks. The final time will depends on what tracks it finally pick.
